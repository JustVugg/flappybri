/* FlappyBri: the model at the controls.
 *
 * Every step the game can be described in a few sentences: where the next gap
 * is, how fast the hummingbird is falling. The pilot sends that description to
 * POST /v1/systemone with one typed question, reads the probability of
 * flapping, and flaps when it is above the threshold.
 *
 * REAL TIME, HONESTLY. One request at a time, and the game does not wait for
 * it: while the model reads, the pipes keep coming. The answer is about the
 * screen the model saw, and it is applied to the screen as it is when the
 * answer arrives, the way a slow reflex would be. How many steps late that is
 * gets measured and shown, not hidden. */
